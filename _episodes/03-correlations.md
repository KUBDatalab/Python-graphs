# Correlations

If one variable goes up, what happens to the other variable? How are they
correlated?

## Scatterplots
Shows the relation between two numeric variables. Each dot represents one 
observation. The position of the dot on the X-axis (horisontal, AKA abscissa), 
represents the value of the first variable for that observation. The position
of the dot on the Y-axis (vertical, AKA ordinate), represents the value of 
the second variable for that observation.
