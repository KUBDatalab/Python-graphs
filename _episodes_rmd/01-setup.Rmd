## Setup

We are working with ggplot here. Base is nice. Plotly is also nice. But we are
far from finished with what we've started here. So for now we are sticking with
ggplot2.

Besides ggplot2, we are working with other libraries to extend the functionality
of ggplot or access interesting data.

Therefore: Install the following libraries:
```{r eval = F}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("cowplot")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

And load them:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(palmerpenguins)
```
